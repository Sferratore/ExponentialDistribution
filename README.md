# ExponentialDistribution

ExponentialDistribution is a jupyter file which illustrates theory and use of the exponential distribution concept using python.

The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. 
It is often associated with the Poisson process, where events happen one after another with no fixed time between them.
